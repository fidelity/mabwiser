# MABWiser: Parallelizable Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits 

MABWiser ([IJAIT 2021](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0218213021500214), [ICTAI 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8995418)) is a research library written in Python for rapid prototyping of multi-armed bandit algorithms. It supports **context-free**, **parametric** and **non-parametric** **contextual** bandit models and provides built-in parallelization for both training and testing components. 

The library also provides a simulation utility for comparing different policies and performing hyper-parameter tuning. MABWiser follows a scikit-learn style public interface, adheres to [PEP-8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), and is tested heavily. 

MABWiser is developed by the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence at Fidelity Investments. Documentation is available at [fidelity.github.io/mabwiser](https://fidelity.github.io/mabwiser).

## Quick Start

```python
# An example that shows how to use the UCB1 learning policy
# to choose between two arms based on their expected rewards.

# Import MABWiser Library
from mabwiser.mab import MAB, LearningPolicy, NeighborhoodPolicy

# Data
arms = ['Arm1', 'Arm2']
decisions = ['Arm1', 'Arm1', 'Arm2', 'Arm1']
rewards = [20, 17, 25, 9]

# Model 
mab = MAB(arms, LearningPolicy.UCB1(alpha=1.25))

# Train
mab.fit(decisions, rewards)

# Test
mab.predict()
```

## Available Bandit Policies

Available Learning Policies:
* Epsilon Greedy [1, 2]
* LinGreedy [1, 2]
* LinTS [3]
* LinUCB [4]
* Popularity [2]
* Random [2]
* Softmax [2]
* Thompson Sampling (TS) [5]
* Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) [2]

Available Neighborhood Policies: 
* Clusters [6]
* K-Nearest [7, 8]
* LSH Nearest [9]
* Radius [7, 8]
* TreeBandit [10]
